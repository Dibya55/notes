1)What is Angular? How does it differ from other JavaScript frameworks like React and Vue?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Angular is preferred over other frameworks for several reasons:

Comprehensive Framework: Angular is a full-fledged framework that provides a complete solution for building large-scale applications, including built-in tools for routing, form handling, and HTTP requests.
TypeScript Integration: Angular is built with TypeScript, which offers static typing, improved code maintainability, and better tooling support, helping developers catch errors early.
Two-Way Data Binding: Angular's two-way data binding simplifies synchronization between the model and the view, reducing boilerplate code and making development more straightforward.
Dependency Injection: Angular has a powerful dependency injection system, making it easier to manage dependencies, enhance modularity, and facilitate testing.
Component-Based Architecture: Angular’s component-based architecture promotes reusable, maintainable, and testable code.
Strong Community and Ecosystem: Angular has a large community, extensive documentation, and a robust ecosystem of third-party libraries and tools.
Opinionated Framework: Angular provides a set of conventions and best practices, which can speed up the development process and ensure consistency across the application.
Performance Optimization: Angular includes features like Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation and tree shaking, which improve application performance.
Enterprise-Level Support: Angular is backed by Google, offering long-term support and stability, which is critical for enterprise applications.
Testing: Angular comes with built-in testing utilities like Jasmine and Karma, making it easier to write and run unit and end-to-end tests.

2)Explain the basic architecture of an Angular application.
---------------------------------------------------------------
The basic architecture of an Angular application is built around several key concepts and components that work together to create a robust, maintainable, and scalable application. Here’s an overview of the core parts of Angular architecture:

1. Modules (NgModules)
Purpose: Angular apps are modular, and the modules are containers for various parts of an application like components, directives, pipes, and services.
Example: Every Angular application has at least one module, the root module, usually called AppModule.
Structure:
typescript
Copy code
@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent, OtherComponent],
  imports: [BrowserModule, AppRoutingModule],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
2. Components
Purpose: Components are the building blocks of an Angular application. Each component has an associated template (HTML) and stylesheet (CSS).
Example: The root component is typically called AppComponent.
Structure:
typescript
Copy code
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'app';
}
3. Templates
Purpose: Define the HTML view of the component. Templates use Angular’s declarative syntax, including directives and data binding to render the view.
Example:
html
Copy code
<h1>{{title}}</h1>
<app-other-component></app-other-component>
4. Directives
Purpose: Directives are classes that add additional behavior to elements in the Angular applications. There are three types: structural (e.g., *ngIf, *ngFor), attribute, and custom.
Example:
html
Copy code
<div *ngIf="isVisible">Visible Content</div>
5. Services and Dependency Injection
Purpose: Services are used for business logic, data management, and external interactions. Angular’s dependency injection system allows services to be injected into components and other services.
Example:
typescript
Copy code
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class DataService {
  getData() {
    return [/* data */];
  }
}
6. Routing
Purpose: The Angular Router enables navigation between views or different parts of the application. Routes are defined in the AppRoutingModule.
Example:
typescript
Copy code
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'home', component: HomeComponent },
  { path: 'about', component: AboutComponent },
  { path: '', redirectTo: '/home', pathMatch: 'full' },
];

@NgModule({
  imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
  exports: [RouterModule]
})
export class AppRoutingModule { }
7. Pipes
Purpose: Pipes are used to transform data in templates. Angular provides built-in pipes like DatePipe, UpperCasePipe, and CurrencyPipe, and custom pipes can be created.
Example:
html
Copy code
<p>{{ date | date:'shortDate' }}</p>
8. Forms
Purpose: Angular provides two ways to handle forms: Template-driven forms and Reactive forms. Forms are used to handle user input and validation.
Example:
typescript
Copy code
// Reactive Form Example
this.form = this.fb.group({
  name: ['', Validators.required]
});
Putting It All Together
An Angular application typically starts with the root module (AppModule) and root component (AppComponent). The AppModule bootstraps the application, and the AppComponent serves as the entry point. Components interact with services for business logic and data fetching. Templates render the views, using directives and pipes to enhance the HTML. The router manages navigation between different views.

This modular and declarative approach makes Angular applications scalable and maintainable.

3)What are the key features of Angular?
-------------------------------------------
	same ans like question1 
 
4) What is TypeScript, and why is it used with Angular?

TypeScript enhances JavaScript by adding static typing, classes, interfaces, and other features that improve code quality, maintainability, and developer productivity. Angular leverages TypeScript to provide a robust framework for building scalable and maintainable web applications. The integration of TypeScript with Angular enables better tooling, early error detection, and a structured approach to application development.,

also angular framework is written with ts itself.So its bettervto prefer typescript over javascrript.
 

5) Describe the role of decorators in Angular. Provide examples of some commonly used decorators.
------------------------------------------
Decorator are meta-data which is applied / decorated on the class level as shown below. If you decorate “@Component” on the class the class is treated as Angular component. 
@Component() export class AppComponent {} 
If you decorate “@NgModule”  on the class it becomes a Angular Module. 
@NgModule({}) export class MyModule { } 


@input ,@output , @ngIf, @ngFor

6) How does data binding work in Angular? Explain the different types of data binding.

Data binding defines how the view and component communicate with each other. There are four types of bindings in Angular as shown below. 

Expression / Interpolation {{}}: - Data flows from component to the view and we can mix the same with HTML tags. 
Property binding []: - Data flows from component to the view. 
Event Binding (): - When you want to send event from the view to the component. 
Two-way binding [()] :- Data flows from component to the view and vice versa. 

 
7 ) Component and Template:
 Component: The TypeScript class that contains the data and logic. It's decorated with the @Component decorator that provides metadata.
Template: The HTML (inline or external) that defines the view for the component. It uses Angular's template syntax to bind data and handle events.
By separating the logic (component class) from the view (template), Angular promotes a modular and maintainable code structure, making it easier to develop, test, and maintain complex applications.

8) What is an Angular component? How is it created and structured?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
An Angular component is a fundamental building block of an Angular application. It controls a part of the user interface (UI) and defines the logic, data, and presentation for that section of the UI. Each component in Angular is a TypeScript class that is decorated with the @Component decorator, which provides metadata about the component.

Creating and Structuring an Angular Component
Step 1: Create a Component
You can create a component using the Angular CLI (Command Line Interface). For example, to create a new component called example, you would run the following command:

sh
Copy code
ng generate component example
This command generates several files related to the component:

example.component.ts (TypeScript file)
example.component.html (HTML template file)
example.component.css (CSS file for styles)
example.component.spec.ts (Unit test file)
Step 2: Structure of a Component
Component Class (TypeScript File)
The component class contains the logic and data for the component. It is decorated with the @Component decorator, which provides metadata such as the selector, template, and styles.

example.component.ts:

typescript
Copy code
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',            // The custom HTML tag for the component
  templateUrl: './example.component.html',  // Path to the HTML template
  styleUrls: ['./example.component.css']    // Path to the CSS styles
})
export class ExampleComponent {
  title = 'Hello, Angular!';
  count = 0;

  increment() {
    this.count++;
  }
}
Template (HTML File)
The template defines the structure and layout of the view controlled by the component. It uses Angular template syntax for data binding and handling events.

example.component.html:

html
Copy code
<div>
  <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
  <p>Count: {{ count }}</p>
  <button (click)="increment()">Increment</button>
</div>
Styles (CSS File)
The styles file contains CSS rules specific to the component. These styles apply only to this component, thanks to Angular's view encapsulation.

example.component.css:

css
Copy code
/* Styles for ExampleComponent */
h1 {
  color: blue;
}
Unit Test (Spec File)
The spec file contains unit tests for the component. It ensures that the component's logic works as expected.

example.component.spec.ts:

typescript
Copy code
import { ComponentFixture, TestBed } from '@angular/core/testing';
import { ExampleComponent } from './example.component';

describe('ExampleComponent', () => {
  let component: ExampleComponent;
  let fixture: ComponentFixture<ExampleComponent>;

  beforeEach(async () => {
    await TestBed.configureTestingModule({
      declarations: [ ExampleComponent ]
    })
    .compileComponents();
  });

  beforeEach(() => {
    fixture = TestBed.createComponent(ExampleComponent);
    component = fixture.componentInstance;
    fixture.detectChanges();
  });

  it('should create', () => {
    expect(component).toBeTruthy();
  });

  it('should increment count', () => {
    component.increment();
    expect(component.count).toBe(1);
  });
});
How Components Work Together
Component Class: Contains the data and logic (properties and methods).
Template: Defines how the data is displayed in the UI.
Styles: Provide component-specific styling.
Selector: The custom HTML tag that can be used to include the component in other templates.
Example of Including a Component
To include the ExampleComponent in another component's template, use its selector (app-example):

html
Copy code
<!-- app.component.html -->
<app-example></app-example>

What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites.
 
What are the data types in JavaScript?

JavaScript has several data types, including number, string, boolean, null, undefined, object, and symbol (added in ECMAScript 6).
 
How do you declare a variable in JavaScript?

You can declare a variable using the var, let, or const keywords.
 
What's the difference between let, const, and var for variable declaration?

var has function scope, while let and const have block scope. Additionally, const is used for declaring constants that cannot be reassigned after initialization.
 
What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during compilation.
 
Explain the difference between == and ===.

== is the equality operator that performs type coercion, while === is the strict equality operator that compares both value and type without type coercion.
 
What is the DOM (Document Object Model)?

The DOM is a programming interface provided by browsers that represents the structure of a web document as a tree of objects.

It allows JavaScript to interact with and manipulate HTML and XML documents.
 
What are JavaScript closures?

Closures are functions that remember the variables from the scope in which they were created, even if they are called in a different scope.
 
Explain callback functions.

Callback functions are functions passed as arguments to other functions, which are then invoked once an operation is complete. 

They are commonly used for asynchronous operations.
 
What is an event in JavaScript?

An event is an action or occurrence that happens in the browser, like a button click, mouse movement, or keyboard input.

JavaScript can be used to respond to these events.
 
How do you handle errors in JavaScript?

Errors can be handled using try-catch blocks. The try block contains the code that might throw an exception, 

while the catch block handles the error if one occurs.
 
What is the purpose of setTimeout()?

setTimeout() is a function that allows you to schedule a function to run after a specified amount of time (in milliseconds) has passed.
 
What is the purpose of JSON.parse() and JSON.stringify()?

JSON.parse() is used to parse a JSON string and convert it into a JavaScript object. JSON.stringify() is used to convert a JavaScript object into a JSON string.
 
What is AJAX?

AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a set of web development techniques that allows you to make asynchronous requests

to a server without needing to reload the entire page.
 
What is the difference between null and undefined?

null is a value that represents the intentional absence of any object value, while undefined is a value that indicates a variable has been declared but has not been assigned a value.
